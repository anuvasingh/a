    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to create certain logic gates using only wires, Logic Inputs, Logic Outputs, and Two-input NAND Gates.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challenges figuring out the combination of nand to create XOR. </p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>Instructor could give example of forming one of the gates.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now have a visual of each gate with their inputs and outputs.</p>
