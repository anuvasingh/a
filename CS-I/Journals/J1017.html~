    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?</h3>
    <p>The output of the Carry column represents the disjunction (OR).</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?</h3>
    <p>The output of the Sum column represents XOR.</p>
      
    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?</h3>
    <p> It is the same.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Why is this true?</h3>
    <p>The carry in the input is zero, so it doesn't effect the truth tables.</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Question 1:Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h3>
    <p> They don't have carries and it is the only place in which it can be used.
      <h3>Question 2:  Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?</h3>
      <p> No, the because the carries change based on the left digit.
      
	<h3>Question 3: Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that {\displaystyle C_{15}}{\displaystyle C_{15}} is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?</h3>
	<p> The numbers are high.<p>



    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned the system computers use to calculate. </p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when...I wasn't sure if the first question was OR. </p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by... show more examples. </p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I learned about carries. </p>
