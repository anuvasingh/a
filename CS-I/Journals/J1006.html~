      <h2>Section 1:</h2>
      <h3>Question 1: What is Git communicating to you?</h3>
      <p>commit meta data - commit#, authour data, file </p>
    
      <h3>Question 2: What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?</h3>
      <p>The git log shows the repository's commit history while the git commit captures the state of the program at certain periods.<p>
	
	<h3>Question 3: Why do you think this is?</h3>
	Maybe because the git log needs commands to put in a list and the commit provides that.

	<h2>Section 2:</h2>
	<h3>Question 1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
      File1.txt is tracked and modified. The file2.txt is untracked.

<h3>     Question 2: Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?</h3>
      <p>    No because they are two different files</p>
      <h2> Section 3: </h2>
<h3>     Question 1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
      <p>  They are modified and green because they have been added as files.</p>
      
<h3> Question 2: Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed. </h3>
    <p> File1.txt is modified and file2.txt is shown as a new file.</p>

    
      <h2> Section 4: </h2>
      <h3>Question 1: How many files are listed as having been changed?</h3>
    <p> 2 files </p>   
<h3>Question 2: What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed</h3>

<p> The red lists the deleted content in the first file. The green lists the added line in the new files.</p>
<h2> Section 5: </h2>
<h3>What does Git tell you has changed? Why?</h3>
<p>When a file has changed. The git compares the current stats with those cached in the index.</p>
