    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction?</h3>
    <p> The symbol is used to show that either of the outputs are true but both together are not true. </p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1:Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula? </h3>
    <p>The formula for the number of rows in a truth table only relates to the number of inputs because the number of inputs would be the same amount as outputs. The formula 2^n is the possible combination of truth values because each letter could be true or false.
