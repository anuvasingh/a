<h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3> Question 1: Why do you think Hello world is typically the first program taught to students? </h3>
<p> Printing "Hello, World!" is a very basic program taught to students because it shows how coding works. The user inputs instructions to print statements and they are able to see how code operates correctly. Students with little experience with coding are able to execute the Hello World program with little to no errors as well.
  <h3>Question 2:How might the Hello World program be different, depending on the programming language it's written in?</h3>
<p>  Every coding program such as C++, Swift, or Python has different instructions for the Hello World Program. Some languages include the print() and some or use int main() or other combinations to code. Languages vary because each language is suitable for different things. </p>

<h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
<p>I encountered challlenges when running when figuring out where I could type "Hello, World!" to execute it correctly (without looking at an online resource. I overcomed this by merlin testing the code and analyzing the errors carefully. >

<h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
<p>The Hello World Programs were all on different missions. It was time-consuming to merlin prepare all of them and go into their seperate directories. Instead putting a-fill-in-the-blank-style activity on one mission like C101.  </p>
<h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
<p>I have learned that there are many different types of coding languages. All of them vary because they are suitable for different situations and cases. From now on, I will think about how Swift varies from other languages and why.</p>
