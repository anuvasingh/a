<h1>CS-I Journal J1151: Conditional and Flow Chart</h1>

<h2>Section 1</h2>
<h3>Question 1: How does branching enable significantly more complex program behavior?</h3>
<p>Branching allows errors to be isolated in the code so that less experienced coders may integrate new versions easily. </p>
<h3>Question 2: Why do you think the term consequent is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the Boolean test evaluates to true?</h3><p> The consequent means a result or effect, and true is the result of a condition occuring.  
<h2>Section 2</h2>
<h3>Question 1: Why is the first Jump instruction conditional? What determines whether the jump will be executed or not? </h3>
There should be an alternate choice for if it is false because then there would only be the consequent outcome.
<h3>Question 2: What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent? </h3>
<p> The jump instruction to go directly to the instruction for the condition. </p>
<h3>Question 3: </h3>
<p> It runs in a sequential order and the alteralternative is the consequent after alternative.</p>

<h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
<p>I encountered challlenges when creating the flow charts and making them complex to show my understanding.</p>
<h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
<p>This experience could be improved by being more specific with how the flow charts are graded.</p>
<h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
<p>I now understand conditionals, booleans, and flow charts and how they apply to real life situations. As I code, I understand how the computer reads each statement to determine whether a condition is true or false.</p>
