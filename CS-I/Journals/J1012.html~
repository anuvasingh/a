    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.</h3>
    <p>First, the oneâ€™s place digits are listed in the first column (adends). Then, add the digits and carry the extra value from the base value or above to the left. Then add and carry until there is no digit to carry.  The number on the bottom is the sum.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?</h3>
    <p>The base is 8. When adding the sum of the digits of the ones place if it's greater than 7 minus by 8 and carry that number. If the sum is 7 the carry is 0.</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?</h3>
    <p>10 is A, 11 is B, 12 is C, 13 is D, 14 is E, 15 is F. Use letters instead of numbers when the digit is above nine. Sum can be written as numbers and letters.</p>

    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?</h3>
     <p>The position starts at 0. Then add digits and carry like normal. Sum will have 0 and 1s.</p>
