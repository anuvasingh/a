    <h1>CS-I Journal J1002: Hello World</h1>
    <p>Name: Anuva Singh</p>
    <p>Date: 30-Aug-2022</p>

    <p>I received assistance from: Andrew Lin</p>
    <p>I assisted: Lin</p>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Name at least two other services that you personally use that are implemented using a Client/Server model.</h3>
    <p>Two other services that I use that use a Client/Server model are Canvas and Skyward.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create the directory of the same name is important?Why?</h3>
    <p>It is important that two different users can create directories of the same name because all users can have same directory structure for consistency.</p>
    
    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Question 2: Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represnt it?</h3>
    <p> The special symbol is to show that the user is in the home directory and isn't in another directory or file.</p>
    
    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</h3>
    <p> Yes, I made the file and transported to the file using cd. This is useful because we can got through files that are organized.</p>

    <h2>Section 5</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What happens each time you press the up arrow?</h3>
    <p> The up arrow allows me to up to the previous commands. </p>

    <h3>Question 2: What happens each time you press the down arrow</h3>
    <p> The down arrow allows me to go down the command list. </p>

    <h2>Section 6:</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</h3>
    <p> No, "Hello World" was not printed to the screen as before cause it was written within the out.txt file. </p> 

    <h2>Section 7:</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: How does the ls command differ from the tree command?</h3>
      <p> The ls command allows the user to see the list of directories in a directory. The tree command looks like an inverted tree and shows the list of directories and sub-directories.</p>
	<h3>Question 2:How do you choose one over the other?</h3>
      <p> The tree command would be useful to see all the directories and subdir. all at once. The ls command just shows what the files are in that current directory. I can choose which one wether I want to see the entire directories or specific ones.</p>
	<h2>Section 8:</h2>
	<h3>Question 1:What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</h3>
	<p>It delays the next command for the number of seconds as specified in the argument. </p>
	
	  <h3>Question 2:Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</h3>
	<p>When the user specifies the time for the sleep it will pause for that amount of time.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Section 9:</h2>
  <h3>Question 1: How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h3>
	  <p>When we put the "&" after sleep command it runs the job in the background and the prompt ie the pwd is shown to take the next command</p>
	  
	  <h3>Question 2:  What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h3>
    <p> You can still give more commands while the job is running in the background</p>
    
	  <h3>Question 3: What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies</h3>
    <p>The number specified in the bracket is the job number that is running in the background</p>
    
	  <h2>Section 10:</h2>
          <h3> What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?</h3>
    <p> It lists the stopped and running jobs</p>
    
          <h3> How do you explain your observations?</h3>
	  <p>As and when the jobs keep on completing the jobs command lists a different set of stopped and running jobs</p>

	  <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that many clients having same directory structure can
    be linked to the same server</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when running the command chmod u+x setPermissions.sh. I do not understand what happened with this command and what is u+x</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by given more details of what the script does and details of the command like for chmod u+x .</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that how client/server model works.</p>
